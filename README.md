# Pairing is Caring 2

Pairing is Caring is great! However, it needs some updates and modifications to really
shine, especially when used across campuses.

I'm working on this independently, hoping to whip the app into shape by making the following
improvements:

- UI/UX updates to make workflows for both students and mentors smoother
- Design polish, both to align the app with DBC branding, as well as make it fun and easy to use
- Streamlining of forms, namely for new mentor availability
- Better responsive layout and design for use on mobile devices
- Adhere to modern HTML/CSS standards
- More permanent user authentication system/flow (social login?)

More forthcoming!
